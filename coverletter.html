                Im Benjamin Sarras, please accept this letter and the attached resume as an indication of my sincere interest in the open Software Engineer position at Intel while I was reviewing your post, that I found on Linkedin. I would be really grateful to be part in the Intel Family an be able to pursuit one of my biggest interest, I was pleased to see that your firm operates in a wide variety areas to which I am particularly attracted.


                Throughout my college career, the courses I found most interesting were those revolving around subjects such as Web development, Coding languages and Agile implementation. From my coursework and professional experiences, I have developed the researching, analytical thinking and coding skills necessary to be a successfulDeveloper. In addition, I am aware of the long hours, hard work and obstacles that is required of the role. I am ready to dedicate myself to Develop. 

                I am eager to learn from the many successful Developers and I hope that you will afford me the opportunity to become a member of your team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
