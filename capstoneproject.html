			<h2>Capstone Project</h2>

            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>Our system lets users create and edit quizzes, and communicate with others through our forum. It helps educators and students share academic content beyond what's taught in school, and explore subjects they're interested in. The forum lets users give feedback, share ideas, and communicate with others.</p>
            <h3>Project Vision</h3>
            <p>Our primary goal for this project is to enable users to communicate with each other using the forum system we are developing. In addition to the forum, any registered user can create quizzes.</p>
            <h3>Project/Business Requirements</h3>
            <p>Enabling users to share their knowledge through quizzes will give others the opportunity to learn about topics that may not be available elsewhere. In addition to this, users can provide feedback, share their ideas, and more through our Forum feature. Rather than using a complex system that includes chatting, commenting, or competing in quizzes, users can work through the quizzes at their own pace and leisure. If desired, users can use our separate Forum feature to communicate with others on the platform.</p>
            <h3>Project plan</h3>
            <p>QuizHoot is a new project that will provide an online quiz and forum system to help students and users worldwide. The project will run from January to April 2023, and offer community-driven and professionally-built quizzes. The system will include a user-friendly interface and a forum-based communication platform. The plan includes risk management, communication strategies, assumptions, and a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with five tasks. Monthly progress reports, quarterly reviews, and meetings will ensure effective communication.</p>
            <h3>Requirements and Design</h3>
            <p>For this project we used: -Firebase, -React, -Postcss and Tailwind</p>
